### :key: Restrictions

- This is a public project containing major amount of codes of the app `Reminder: S`.
- The repository will *NOT* be updated to match every build of the original app in the AppStore, as the public repository only contains initial version of the app on purpose.
- The repository will *NOT* compile successfully since it needs accesses to the private components: `Sphere` and `SNKit`.
